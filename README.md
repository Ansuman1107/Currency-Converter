# 🌍 Currency Converter

Easily convert currencies with real-time exchange rates in a clean, user-friendly interface. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this app fetches live rates to provide up-to-date conversions across currencies.

## 🚀 Learning Journey

In this project, I explored key JavaScript concepts to make the app responsive and efficient:

- **Callbacks** and **Promises**: To handle asynchronous operations seamlessly.
- **Async/Await**: For more readable and organized asynchronous code.
- **Fetch API**: To retrieve live currency data from an API, ensuring accurate conversions.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-Time Currency Conversion**: Get the latest exchange rates for your conversions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean layout with intuitive input fields for quick and easy conversions.
- **Instant Calculations**: Conversion results update as you type in amounts, making it highly responsive.

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Select** the currencies you want to convert between from the dropdown.
2. **Enter** the amount you wish to convert.
3. View the **converted amount** instantly.
